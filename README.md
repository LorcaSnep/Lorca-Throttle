To begin, this repository serves as an archive of my work relating to this project for the purposes of my university studies.  All items in this repository are work in progress and are NOT finalized.

The DCC-EX project represents a remarkable achievement for model railroading.  For approximately 50 USD, it is possible to build a fully functioning, JMRI compatible DCC command station.  However, one key element is not ideal; throttles.  Some excellent options do exist such as the TCS UWT series throttles and the LoDi-Con throttle.  To be clear, these are excellent devices that are thoughtfully built by extremely talented people.  However, these, and most off the-shelf throttles, are quite expensive.  This is where this project comes into play.  I began this project with two simple goals.  Design a wireless Throttle for 100 USD or less, and to design it as compact and ergonomic as possible.

This device is based on the ESP32-WROOM-32E microprocessor on a custom designed pair of boards running the WiTcontroller code (https://github.com/flash62au/WiTcontroller) written by Peter Akers.  Having used a throttle based on this code for approximately 1 year, it has proven to be quite reliable and has a wide feature set that I appreciate including integration with JMRI rosters, function lists, and accessory decoder lists.

As of 9/21/25, the electronics are nearly finalized.  Each aspect of them is functioning and I am waiting on the delivery of version 3.2 of the PCBs and the 3D printed case components.  This should conclude the prototype phase for the PCBs.  The one aspect of the PCBs that will not be populated and will be left for a future version is the hardware for a charging dock based on pogo pins.
