To begin, this repository serves as an archive of my work relating to this project for the purposes of my university studies.  All items in this repository are work in progress and are NOT finalized.

The DCC-EX project represents a remarkable achievement for model railroading.  For approximately 50 USD, it is possible to build a fully functioning, JMRI compatible DCC command station.  However, one key element is not ideal; throttles.  Some excellent options do exist such as the TCS UWT series throttles and the LoDi-Con throttle.  To be clear, these are excellent devices that are thoughtfully built by extremely talented people.  However, these, and most offthe-shelf throttles, are quite expensive.  This is where this project comes into play.  I began this project with two simple goals.  Design a Throttle for 100 USD or less, and to design it as compact and ergonomic as possible.

This device is based on the ESP32-WROOM-32E microprocessor running the WiTcontroller code (https://github.com/flash62au/WiTcontroller) written by Peter Akers.  Having used a throttle based on this code for approximately 1 year, it has proven to be quite reliable and has a wide feature set that I appreciate including integration with JMRI rosters, function lists, and accessory decoder lists.
